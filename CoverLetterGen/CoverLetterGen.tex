I have gained interest in your open position because I enjoy TASK. I believe that COMPANY will allow me to excel at performing TASK. In my coursework I gained experience using TECHNOLOGY. While I /don't/ consider myself an expert, I did learn the basic concepts behind TECHNOLOGY. In my internship I learned about clarifying and implementing projects received from a client. I also learned about testing newly implemented code and automating the same testing for an application. My resume contains other technologies and experiences which may interest you as well.
%PARAGRAPH TWO: Indicate why you are interested in the position, the company, its products, services - above all, stress what you can do for the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate for the position.

Refer the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes your qualifications, training, and experiences. The purpose of this section is to strengthen your resume by providing details which bring your experiences to life. 
 
 I would like to request an interview. I will be available from DATE any time from TIME to TIME.

I may also be contacted at my phone number which is \href{tel:3049560266}{(304)-956-0266}. I will attempt to contact you for further discussion on DATE. Thank you for your consideration.
%PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and indicate your flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example, state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up an interview. Alternatively, state that you will call on a certain date to set up an interview. End the letter by thanking the employer for taking time to consider your credentials.
